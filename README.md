# SECR1013-Digital-Logic

<h2>Course summary</h2>
This course was taught by Dr. Nurfazrina binti Mohd Zamry in the span of 15 weeks. This course
contains foundation of all microprocessor based system in
computers . We were taught the principles digital systems from fundamentals to programmable logic device.
We also get to design and simulate digital circuits using Deeds software. We were also able to apply what we've learned through lab and projects.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Discrete structure built a foundation for me to understand basic algorithms and data structures that I will use in programming. It has also enhance my problem-solving skills as most of the problems discussed in this subject are based of real life. I wished that I had allocate my time more to do exercises and practices to understand this subject better as the subject is quite complex.
