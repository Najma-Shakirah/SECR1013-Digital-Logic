# SECR1013-Digital-Logic

<h2>Course summary</h2>
This course was taught by Dr. Nurfazrina binti Mohd Zamry in the span of 15 weeks. This course
contains foundation of all microprocessor based system in
computers . We were taught the principles digital systems from fundamentals to programmable logic device.
We also get to design and simulate digital circuits using Deeds software. We were also able to apply what we've learned through lab and projects.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This course has helped me learn the fundamentals of electronic circuits and how to manipulate them. I think the knowledge I gained by learning the underlying hardware of digital systems can help me write more optimized and efficient code. Things that I could improve are to do more circuit simulations using Deeds and exercises to further understand the subject.
